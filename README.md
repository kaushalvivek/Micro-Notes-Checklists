# Micro Notes and Checklists

Before every exam, exactly the night before it, I prepare a checklist of things to study. Occasionally with micro-notes.
I felt this might be useful to someone looking to explore those topics, or studying for the same exam, if you happen to be at IIIT.

For any course material, feel free to mail me.
